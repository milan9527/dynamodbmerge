# GitHub Push Instructions

The repository has been initialized locally with all your code. To push it to GitHub, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. First, make sure you have a GitHub account and have created the repository at https://github.com/milan9527/dynamodbmerge

2. You'll need to authenticate with GitHub. You have two options:

## Option 1: Using Personal Access Token (PAT)

1. Generate a Personal Access Token on GitHub:
   - Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Generate new token
   - Give it a name and select the "repo" scope
   - Copy the generated token

2. Push using the token:
```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/ddbmerge
git push -u origin main
```

When prompted for credentials, use your GitHub username and the token as the password.

## Option 2: Using SSH

1. Generate an SSH key if you don't have one:
```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

2. Add the SSH key to your GitHub account:
   - Copy the public key: `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`
   - Go to GitHub → Settings → SSH and GPG keys → New SSH key
   - Paste your key and save

3. Change the remote URL to use SSH:
```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:milan9527/dynamodbmerge.git
```

4. Push your code:
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

## After Pushing

Once you've pushed your code, you can verify it's on GitHub by visiting:

Your repository is now ready for collaboration and further development!
